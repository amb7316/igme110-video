      After finding multiple video clips on Pexels, I added them to a playlist and edited them together using Shotcut. By cutting down clips to make them shorter and trying to add different types of cuts, I wanted to make a romantic and nostalgic feeling of a newly married couple looking back on their relationship. The speed property and the fade in/out filters were particularly useful for acheiving this effect. The video could have probably stayed noiseless but I felt that the music I added, Starling, would help to enhance the emotions being portrayed.
